How to install Messenger at older version
go to:

https://store.rg-adguard.net/

...you can paste this url for the Microsoft Store link:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/messenger/9wzdncrf0083

This will give you links to the appx's available.

It gave me an option to download two versions (one being the current and an older one): 970.11.116.0

From there you can open up Powershell and use the command:

Add-AppxPackage -Path "C:\Path\to\File.Appx"
